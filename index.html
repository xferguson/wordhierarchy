	<h1>Word Hierarchy</h1>
	<p>This is a very basic tool inspired by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/BWxtIxChcB3/">this instagram post</a> from the book <a href="https://www.vyvevans.net/the-emoji-code">the Emoji Code</a></p>
	<p>The intention is to build similar hierarchies of words. Pretty simple.</p>
	<p>I'm using the same hierarchy as in the post/book as an example of how it works.</p>
